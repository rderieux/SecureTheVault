# SecureTheVault

Overview
JavaScript creates so much more functionality for a site and automates processes. You are building a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to generate the three codes in a combination. Use the JavaScript console or the script block within an HTML page to create three variables. Each variable will be the result of each calculation (three in total). The combination of the lock is 10 - 40 - 39. You must use three different arithmetic operators that will generate each individual number, then display the combination on the HTML page, or in an alert popup.

Remember to use the MDN documentationLinks to an external site. if you need help with keywords, methods, or something else. An internet search for "mdn <thing you are trying to do>" usually works great for getting you to the correct MDN page you want.

Requirements
Before anything else, write the pseudocode of your steps and how you will solve this exercise.
Create a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:
Assign three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator(+-\*/). Each must equal one of the three codes in the combination.

Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process.
Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog.
Please submit either a file with your code or a screenshot of the code, with the pseudocode showing, or a GitHub link.
